## Note

We've developed an IDE that supports three operating systems: Windows 8+, macOS (including Apple Silicon), and Linux. We are committed to maintaining and updating the application. It's an open-source application that allows the creation of issues on GitHub and the submission of pull requests, all of which we'll moderate.

The process of obtaining the Apple Developer Program certificate took longer than expected, resulting in a slight delay in the release.
